Instructions for adding a new visualization:

step 1: create a row for the visualization in ../metrics.html
        note that two columns are wrapped in a row <div>
        
step 2: create a new html file in the /visuals folder

step 3: select code from D3plus and copy in everything from the <div> tag with 
        the "viz" id to the closing </script> tag

step 4: give the viz div a class="viz" and change the id to something new 
        (currently viz plus a number i.e "viz4", "viz5" etc...)
        
step 5: add a .title() and fill it with appropriate info

step 6: add a .resize(true)

step 7: in the row created in the ../metrics.html file add the following tag

        {% include new_visualization.html %}

step 6: use django template tags to generate appropriate javascript to 
        populate the visualization with data
